Taylor graduated from Widener University with a BA in English and a minor in environmental studies. She is a recent graduate of Loyola University Chicago with her MA in Textual Studies and Digital Humanities. Taylor is Editor-in-Chief and Co-Founder of [MUDDLE](https://github.com/publishing-bitbytebit/MUDDLE)—the digital lit mag that celebrates the messiness of composition. During her time at Widener, she served as project manager on two scholarly editions of Romantic Poetry and attended a short course on manuscript study at the Wordsworth Trust in Cumbria, England. Since then she has been invited back to the Lake District to present on her project, [The Digital Variorum of Wordsworth's "Nutting"](https://github.com/taylorcate/NuttingVariorum)—an open-source edition run out of GitHub. She is an experienced freelance editor who specializes in technical and academic writing, poetry, short fiction, screenplays, and creative nonfiction. She also has a great deal of experience working with writers who speak English as a second language.

In addition to editing, Taylor writes poetry, short fiction, and creative nonfiction—usually on the topic of the natural world and our interactions in it. Her poetry has been published in _Widener Ink_ as well as in Z Publishing’s _[Pennsylvania’s Best Emerging Poets](https://www.zpublishinghouse.com/products/pennsylvanias-best-emerging-poets?variant=3731821297694)_, and _[America's Emerging Poets 2018: Northeast Region](https://www.zpublishinghouse.com/products/americas-emerging-poets-2018-northeast?variant=17979693105267)_.
